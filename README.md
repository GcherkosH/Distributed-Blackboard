# Distributed-Blackboard 

I used Repy and the Seattle framework to implement a distributed blackboard.  A number of machines around the world, each one having each own blackboard.  When a message is written in one board, it should be also propagated to all other boards
 I have implimented based on various protocols such as LEADER ELECTION algorithm, Consistency through voting based protocol  and Eventual consistency algorithm.
