# Distributed-Blackboard based on various protocols 

I used Repy and the Seattle framework to implement a distributed blackboard.  A number of machines around the world, each one having each own blackboard.  When a message is written in one board, it should be also propagated to all other boards
 I have implimented based on various protocols such as leader election, eventual consistency, quorum consensus.
